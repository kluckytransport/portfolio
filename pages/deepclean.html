    <h1>About Deep Clean:</h1>
    <p>The player is a Marine Scientist or something and likes to keep oceans clean and is towards this goal of making sure they are. They are just in a boat and "saling the sea" meaninglessly and looks around their environment and stumbles across a not very clean ocean and can see some sort of structure slightly deep down. Curiousity hits them and they go down and explore the oceans secrets.</p>
